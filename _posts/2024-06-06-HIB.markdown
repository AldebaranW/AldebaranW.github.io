This paper focused on modeling the privileged knowledge distillation problem from a theory-based perspective, where we provided mathematical analysis and a simple but effective framework HIB for the problem. Empirical experiments on both simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that HIB yields improved generalizability compared to previous methods, which achieved about a 10% performance boost compared with baselines in various tasks.
<!-- In this paper, we formulate the sim-to-real gap as an information bottleneck problem and therefore propose a novel privileged knowledge distillation method called the Historical Information Bottleneck (HIB). In particular, HIB learns a privileged knowledge representation from historical trajectories by capturing the underlying changeable dynamic information. Theoretical analysis shows that the learned privileged knowledge representation helps reduce the value discrepancy between the oracle and learned policies. Empirical experiments on both simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that HIB yields improved generalizability compared to previous methods. -->
